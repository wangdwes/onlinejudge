The Importance of Algorithms 
============================

- definition review
- runtime analysis: worst-base / average-case time complexity
- sorting:
  # bubblesort
  # quicksort
  # heapsort
  # mergesort
- shortest path:
  # djikstra's algorithm
- algorithms
  # heuristic (approximate)
  # random: e.g. quicksort, median
- compression
- importance of knowing algorithms
- maximum flow: soviet union rail network
- dynamic programming: sequence transformation
